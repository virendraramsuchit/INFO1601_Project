    <h2>About This App</h2>
    <p>
        NASA APOD is designed for astronomy enthusiasts and casual stargazers to explore celestial events and space phenomena. 
        Our mission is to make astronomy accessible to everyone by providing curated space content and personalized stargazing recommendations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since our launch in 2023, we've helped over 50,000 users discover the wonders of the night sky.

    <h3>7Timer!</h3>
    <p>
      7Timer! is a series of web-based meteorological forecast products, 
      mainly derived from the NOAA/NCEP-based numeric weather model,
       the Global Forecast System (GFS). 7Timer! was firstly established 
       in July 2005 as an exploration product under support of the 
       National Astronomical Observatories of China and has been largely 
       renovated in 2008 and 2011. Currently it is supported by the Shanghai 
       Astronomical Observatory 
      of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
    </p>
    <p>
      7Timer! produces high-resolution forecasts for the entire globe 
      that cover about 1.5 million geographic points, and would be 
      updated four times a day. It also produces specialized products 
      for users with different concentrations such as 
      astronomy or meteorology.
